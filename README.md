The ultimate PHP doc includes basics and database PDO connection.
<br>
Welcome to Ultimate_PHP_Documentation, your ultimate guide to mastering PHP. 
<br>
This documentation will help you become a good PHP developer.
<br>
In the files of this git you will find the following pages:

<ul>
    <li>Basics</li>
    <li>Database_PDO</li>
    <li>Simple Website Template</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Basics</b></h2> 
On this page I explain basic things like variable arrays and loops.

<br>

<h2><b>Database_PDO</b></h2> 
Here I explain the most important things about database connection with PDO (select, update, delete).

<br>

<h2><b>Simple Website Template</b></h2> 
On this page I added a simple website template so you don't need to program one by yourself and instead be able to start using PHP directly.

<br>

<h2 style="color: red;"><b>Attention</b></h2> 
Please note that i can't explain 100% of php. 
<br>
I explain what I consider the basics to be able to use php.
<br>
There is also a folder with components. 
<br>
This folder contains css, js and images to display this Website correctly. 
<br>
I do not recomend to edit them because otherwise the Documentation will not be displayed correctly.
